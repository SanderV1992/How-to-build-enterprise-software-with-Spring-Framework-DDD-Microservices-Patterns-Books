# Domain Driven Design
---

**Domain Driven Design (DDD)** -Ubiquitous Language is a real world problem software design process that can help us come up with the model. It gives us the tools and building blocks necessary to discover and design our model and turn it into working code.

If you know your application is going to grow and is likely to change often, Domain-Driven
Design will definitely help in managing the complexity and refactoring your model over
time.

If you don't understand the Domain you're working on because it's new and nobody has
invested in a solution before, this might mean it's complex enough for you to start applying
Domain-Driven Design. In this case, you'll need to work closely with Domain Experts to get
the models right.

In the problem space, Domain-Driven Design uses Domains and Subdomains to group and
organize what companies want to solve. In the case of an **Online Travel Agency (OTA)**, the
problem is about dealing with things like flight tickets and booking hotels. Such a Domain
can be organized into different Subdomains such as Pricing, Inventory, User Management,
and so on.
